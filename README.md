## Introduction

Ipseity (meaning oneself) is a collection of applications designed for my personal use and learning development

This project is my personal website, designed in elixir using the phoenix framework, I have combined all my previous blog, portfolio, cms api into one project for easier management.

Having experience with fromtend technologies such as reactjs, vuejs, solid, qwik and angular. My personal site does not need the added complexity of multiple dependancies or opionins in a framework changing, thus making the portfolio outdated and vulnerable etc. as I work on both micro-services and monolythic code at work. 

Graphql and Rest API for all swaye chateau sites, designed with security in mind and eas of use

Using Laravel for the initial API, do to low traffic and demand on the application, PHP on a high performance SSD server should be plenty enough for providing API services to application under the Ipseity Group.
